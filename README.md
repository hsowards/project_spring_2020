I'm creating a script/package I'm calling Run SuSiE Run. This package has several goals:
1. Allow me and others in my lab to easily pull GWAS summary stats and reference panel data
2. Make a LD (linkage disequilibrium) matrix with the reference panel data
3. Align and clean the summary stats and LD matrix
4. Fine-map the region using 2 different programs:
    4a. A program written in R named SuSiE
    4b. A program written in C++ named DAP-G

*Important Note: This package, when used in it's full extent u


```
git clone https://github.com/hsowards/project_spring_2020

```

Then open notebooks/RSR.ipynb, which will walk you through the process of finemapping from start to finish.
